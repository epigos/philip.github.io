I am a Software and Machine Learning Engineer with over six years of commercial experience in Python and Golang developing stable and high-performance backend systems. 

I have gained valuable experience in leading development teams and outstanding interpersonal and communication skills from working with diverse people across multiple business areas during this time. 

I am currently a graduate student working towards my MSc in Data science with keen interests in practical applications of Machine learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Computer vision to derive value for consumers and business stakeholders.
